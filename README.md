# 🏛️ Hometown Project: Visit Baalbek

This is a beginner-level project from the Scrimba Full Stack Career Path, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The purpose of the project is to create a simple homepage for a hometown—in this case, **Baalbek, Lebanon**, a city rich in history and Roman architecture.

> ⚠️ I built this project **entirely by myself from scratch**, without help from anyone. All the HTML and CSS code is my own work.
